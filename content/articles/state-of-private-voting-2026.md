## Inside the Report

Private voting is a critical component of decentralized governance, ensuring that participants can cast their votes without fear of coercion or retribution. As the landscape of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and on-chain elections continues to evolve, the need for robust private voting mechanisms becomes increasingly apparent. The [Shutter Network](https://www.shutter.network/) and PSE teams have prepared a report to provide an overview of the current state of private voting protocols on Ethereum, examining various solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for future development.

The report covers the following areas:

- The need for private voting
- The challenges of private voting
- In-depth analysis of private voting protocols, including:
  - [Freedom Tool](https://freedomtool.org/)
  - [MACI V3](https://maci.pse.dev/)
  - [Semaphore V4](https://semaphore.pse.dev/)
  - [Shutter - Shielded Voting](https://www.shutter.network/shielded-voting)
  - [SIV](https://siv.org/)
  - [Incendia](https://incendia.tech/)
  - [DAVINCI](https://davinci.vote/)
  - [Aragon/Aztec](https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html)
  - [Cicada](https://github.com/a16z/cicada)
  - [Enclave](https://www.enclave.gg/)
  - [Kite](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05626)
  - [Shutter - Permanent Shielded Voting](https://www.shutter.network/shielded-voting)
- Recommendations
- Future work

The following is a summary table comparing the different private voting protocols based on the defined properties. You can find more details and information in the full report.

We have since published an update with new properties: "Quantum Resistance" and "Open Source", which you can read about in the full PDF.

We hope you find this report useful and informative as we continue to explore and develop private voting solutions for decentralized governance. We believe the community is doing an amazing job pushing the boundaries of this particular field, and we look forward to seeing how these protocols evolve.
