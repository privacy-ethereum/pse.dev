We demonstrate efficient aggregation of Falcon signatures using LaBRADOR, achieving compact, quantum-resistant proofs. Read the full technical breakdown on [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/lattice-based-signature-aggregation/22282).

Ethereum currently uses BLS signatures, but these are vulnerable to future quantum attacks. Our recent research explores lattice-based signature aggregation using Falcon signatures and the LaBRADOR proof system.

Key highlights:

- **Compact proofs:** Aggregate 10,000 Falcon-512 signatures into a 74 KB proof.
- **Efficient generation:** Proofs generated in \~6 seconds on commodity hardware.
- **Verification optimization:** Current verification time (\~2.6 seconds) identified as a primary bottleneck, with active work to reduce it further.

This work is part of our broader post-quantum initiative at PSE, focusing on securing Ethereum's core infrastructure.
