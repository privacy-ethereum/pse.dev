With the [recent privacy leadership announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/10/01/privacy-cluster-leads), the PSE team wants to take a moment to give a huge thanks to [Sam Richards](https://x.com/samonchain) for his contributions as our team lead over this last years.

PSE has gone through many changes since Barry Whitehat first built a team to explore the edges of applied cryptography. This past year, Sam has guided PSE from a collection of theory-led experiments to a team with a problem-first approach and privacy at its core.

Sam led with clarity and dedication through the reorganization of the Ethereum Foundation earlier this year, and strengthened PSE’s role at a moment of uncertainty. He helped shape the roadmap to bring privacy from an abstract principle to a practical and essential path towards adoption. 

Sam also invested deeply in people—mentoring our team, encouraging us to step outside our bubble, and building bridges across the ecosystem. His leadership ensured that PSE could continue to grow with focus, alignment, and impact. We are so grateful for everything Sam has brought to PSE and wish him the very best in what comes next.

We’re excited to continue building the future of privacy with [Andy Guzman](https://x.com/AndyGuzmanEth) as the new lead of PSE, and [Igor Barinov](https://x.com/barinov) as the coordinator of privacy at the Ethereum Foundation. Together, they will help carry forward the mission of making privacy normal and foundational for Ethereum.
