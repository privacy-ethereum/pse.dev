ZKML is a solution that combines the power of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and machine learning to address the privacy concerns in traditional machine learning. It provides a platform for machine learning developers to convert their TensorFlow Keras models into ZK-compatible versions, ensuring model privacy, data privacy, and transparent verification. ZKML can be used to verify if a specific machine learning model was used to generate a particular piece of content, without revealing the input or the model used. It has potential use cases in on-chain biometric authentication, private data marketplace, proprietary ML model sharing, and AIGC NFTs.
