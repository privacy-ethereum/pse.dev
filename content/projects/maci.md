### Overview

[MACI](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/dev) is a protocol designed to provide a highly secure e-voting solution.

It enables organisations to conduct on-chain voting processes with a significantly reduced risk of cheating, such as bribery or collusion.

MACI uses zero-knowledge proofs to implement a receipt-free voting scheme, making it impossible for anyone other than the vote coordinator to verify how a specific user voted. This ensures the correct execution of votes and allows anyone to verify the results.

It's particularly beneficial for governance and funding events, where its anti-collusion mechanisms help ensure fair and transparent outcomes.

Please refer to MACI's [documentation](https://maci.pse.dev) for more details.

### Features

With MACI, you can take on chain voting to the next level:

1. Uncensorable - no one can censor votes, not even the coordinator
2. Votes are private - votes are sent encrypted on chain and only the voter and the coordinator can decrypt them
3. Fully verifiable voting process - anyone can verify the tally is correct thanks to zero-knowledge proofs
