Jubmoji.quest is a place to keep personal, provable digital mementos from people you meet and places you visit IRL. Each time you tap a card, you collect a Jubmoji, a unique cryptographic signature that you can store privately and share as you wish!

The learnings from this experiment influenced the creation of [Cursive](https://pse.dev/en/projects/cursive) which continues to explore applications of cryptography for human connection.
