EigenTrust is a library designed to manage trust within a distributed network, incorporating zero-knowledge features. It serves as a reputation bank for the Ethereum ecosystem, providing an interoperable layer for managing reputation and trust. The protocol creates zero-knowledge proofs of reputation scores based on ratings given by network participants. This allows for the creation of a reputation system for peer-to-peer marketplaces and exchanges, reputation-weighted voting, and community gatekeeping.
