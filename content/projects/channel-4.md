Channel 4 is a community-driven platform where users can submit and discover content. It uses state channels to incentivize user engagement. When a user likes the content you've submitted, a state channel closes and rewards are dropped into their wallet. This approach combines entertainment with the power of state channels, enabling community members to earn while they engage.
