        TITLE: "01. Cryptography for people",
        DESCRIPTION: [
          'Cryptography is everywhere: every time you connect to a secure site, log in with a password or unlock your phone, you\'re seeing cryptography in action. With "programmable" cryptography (like zero knowledge proofs, multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption) we can make verifiable claims about secret information without revealing the information itself.',
          " This can be applied to identity management, collusion resistance, anonymous communication and so much more. We're building a library of dev tools, research papers, and prototypes that are open source and free for everyone to use. We hope our resources inspire people to innovate the technologies that their communities need.",
        ],
      },
      {
        TITLE: "02. Prioritizing privacy",
        DESCRIPTION: [
          "We believe that privacy is a fundamental right. We want to be part of building an internet that divests from invasive data practices, and instead gives people real choices about who has access to their personal information.",
          " Permission should be purpose specific, revocable, informed and uncoerced. We make tools that help people to securely authenticate themselves, make confidential transactions on the blockchain, and respect and preserve user privacy.",
        ],
      },
      {
        TITLE: "03. Scaling for communities",
        DESCRIPTION: [
          "Zero knowledge proofs can verify computations quickly and cheaply, helping decentralized systems like Ethereum become more efficient. We research, design and share scaling solutions that anyone can use to contribute to a stronger and more practical digital public infrastructure.",
          " We also grow our community by supporting the next generation of builders. We host immersive  programs for students and lecture series that are open to everyone interested in building with cryptography.",

Sometimes our research unlocks a new breakthrough that leads to prototypes, and sometimes we just clarify assumptions and fill in theoretical gaps. We believe meaningful progress comes from applying research to real-world needs. Our work is open source, and we maintain a feedback loop so that challenges from the field can help shape our focus.
