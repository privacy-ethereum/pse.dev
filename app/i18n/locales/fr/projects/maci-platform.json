  "description": "MACI-RPGF is an implementation of EasyRetroPGF with MACI. This project quickly enables any community, organization or ecosystem to run an optimism-style rpgf round. It is highly configurable to enable different gating mechanisms (token based, attestation based, hats-based, etc) and an easy-to-use UI for both: round organizers and voters.",
  "tldr": "Run your optimism-style rpgf round in your community! Forked from EasyRetroPGF and enhanced with MACI for privacy, anti-bribery and anti-collusion"
