tldr: "Anonymity gives people a clean slate to express themselves, unconnected to an existing identity. Reputation provides context: it reveals an aspect about a person's history in relation to others. UniRep protocol adds reputation to anonymity, allowing people to provide relational context without revealing specifics of their history."
