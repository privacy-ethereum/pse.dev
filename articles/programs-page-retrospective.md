### Core Program

PSE's Core Program is an eight-week introductory course for university students looking to explore the world of programmable cryptography. The program will be run hybrid style with online and in-person sessions in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Costa Rica (San Jos√©), Ecuador (Cuenca), Japan (Tokyo), South Korea (Seoul), and Taiwan (Taipei).
By the end of the program, you will gain comprehensive knowledge about Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Multiparty Computation (MPC). You will also bolster your GitHub portfolio, and potentially receive grants for further research and contributions!

### Acceleration program

Acceleration program supports alumni of our entry level programs (e.g. Core Program, ZK Summer, ZK Playground) to deepen explorations of ZKP, FHE, MPC, and related technologies through grants and mentorship. This program operates on a round-based application system, focusing on specific open tasks for each round.
