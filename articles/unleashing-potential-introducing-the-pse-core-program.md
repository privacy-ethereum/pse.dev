Hey there, curious minds! Are you ready to dive into the world of practical skills and open-source project contributions? Well, buckle up because we're about to embark on an exciting journey through the **PSE Core Program!**

PSE's Core Program is an eight-week introductory course for university students looking to explore the world of programmable cryptography. The program will be run hybrid style with online and in-person sessions. in The LatAm Core Program will run from July 22, 2024 - September 15, 2024 in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Costa Rica (San José), Ecuador (Cuenca). The Asia Core Program will run from Jul. 29, 2024 - Sep. 22, 2024 in Japan (Tokyo), South Korea (Seoul), and Taiwan (Taipei).

Submit [an application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSendzYY0z_z7fZ37g3jmydvzS9I7OWKbY2JrqAnyNqeaBHvMQ/viewform) to join!

In today's digital landscape, privacy and security are paramount. That's where Zero Knowledge (ZK) technologies come into play. By allowing parties to verify information without revealing any underlying data, ZK protocols offer a revolutionary solution to protect sensitive information in a world where data breaches and privacy violations are all too common.
With ZK protocols, individuals can engage in transactions, authenticate identities, and share information without compromising their privacy. It's a game-changer for industries ranging from finance and healthcare to communications and beyond.

But here's the best part: you won't be navigating this journey alone. The Core Program works in a **Hybrid Learning Model**. We blend the flexibility of self-learning with weekly in-person meetups. These sessions are all about sparking discussions, networking, and solving challenges together. You'll have mentors, community managers, and more people from the PSE team by your side; plus, weekly in-person meetings where you can network with fellow enthusiasts.

Who knows? You might even meet your future co-founder in one of these sessions.

Throughout the PSE Core Program, participants will dive deep into ZK fundamentals, gain hands-on experience with cutting-
edge technologies, and contribute to real-world projects. As the demand for ZK expertise continues to grow, this program
presents a unique opportunity for participants to carve out a successful career path in a field with a brilliant future ahead.
