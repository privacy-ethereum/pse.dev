Hey there, curious minds! Are you ready to dive into the world of practical skills and open-source project contributions? Well, buckle up because we're about to embark on an exciting journey through the **PSE Core Program**!

In today’s digital landscape, privacy and security are paramount. That’s where Zero Knowledge (ZK) technologies come into play. By allowing parties to verify information without revealing any underlying data, ZK protocols offer a revolutionary solution to protect sensitive information in a world where data breaches and privacy violations are all too common.

With ZK protocols, individuals can engage in transactions, authenticate identities, and share information without compromising their privacy. It's a game-changer for industries ranging from finance and healthcare to communications and beyond.

So, what exactly is this program all about? Picture this: you're a student in Latin America or Asia, eager to enhance your skills and make a meaningful impact in the tech world. That's where the PSE Core Program swoops in to save the day. It's like a beacon of opportunity, shining a light on the path towards knowledge and growth.

Let's delve into the workings:

The program works in a **Hybrid Learning Model.** We blend the flexibility of self-learning with weekly in-person meetups. These sessions are all about sparking discussions, networking, and solving challenges together.

1.  **Stage 0 (Preparation):** Before we kick off, we've got some prep work for you. Dive into modules that cover program logistics, open-source culture, and essential background knowledge for zero-knowledge technology.
2.  **Stage 1 (Weeks 1-5):** It's time to roll up your sleeves and dive into zero-knowledge tech. Guided by seasoned mentors, you'll tackle complex topics with hands-on coding and curated study materials. Plus, Week 3 brings a thrilling hackathon for a break from studying.
3.  **Stage 2 (Weeks 6-8):** Here's where the magic happens. Armed with newfound knowledge and experience, you'll contribute to real-world open-source projects. It's your chance to shine as an open-source developer.

Throughout the program, you'll dive into exciting topics such as:

- Cryptography basics: getting started with Circom, hash functions and more
- KZG commitments and zkSNARKs
- Overview of trusted setups and Groth16
- Deep Dive into PLONK
- Halo2, FHE, MPC
- Explore projects like Sempahore, Bandada, TLSNotary, ZKEmail

But here's the best part: you won't be navigating this journey alone. You'll have mentors, community managers, and more people from the PSE team by your side; plus, weekly in-person meetings where you can network with fellow enthusiasts.

Who knows? You might even meet your future co-founder in one of these sessions.

Throughout the PSE Core Program, participants will dive deep into ZK fundamentals, gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, and contribute to real-world projects. As the demand for ZK expertise continues to grow, this program presents a unique opportunity for participants to carve out a successful career path in a field with a brilliant future ahead.
