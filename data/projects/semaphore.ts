[Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) is a generic privacy layer. Leveraging zero-knowledge technology, users can prove their membership in groups and send messages (extending from votes to endorsements)
off-chain or across EVM-compatible blockchains, all without revealing their personal identity. Use cases include private voting, whistleblowing, anonymous DAOs, and mixers.

Semaphore is designed to be a simple and generic privacy layer for decentralized applications (dApps). It encourages modular application design, allowing
dApp developers to choose and customize the on-chain and off-chain components they need.

The core of the protocol is the circuit logic. In addition to circuits, Semaphore provides [Solidity contracts](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/main/packages/contracts) and
[JavaScript libraries](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/main#-packages) that allow developers to generate zero-knowledge proofs and verify them with minimal effort.

### Features

With Semaphore, you can allow your users to do the following:

1. [Create a Semaphore identity](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/identities)
2. [Add their Semaphore identity to a group (i.e. Merkle tree)](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/groups)
3. [Send a verifiable, anonymous message (e.g. a vote or endorsement)](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/proofs)

When a user broadcasts a message, Semaphore zero-knowledge proofs can ensure that the user has joined the group and hasn't already cast a message with a nullifier.
