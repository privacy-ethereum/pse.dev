### Scaling Semaphore ‚Äì Private Merkle-Path Retrieval with PIR  

#### Project Overview  
The project tackles the privacy bottleneck that appears when Semaphore groups grow to millions of members. In large groups, a user must obtain their Merkle-path (all sibling hashes from leaf to root) from a remote database before they can create a zero-knowledge membership proof. Asking for that path na√Øvely reveals **which identity** they own.  

This project solves the problem by letting users **query the server with Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**. PIR lets a client fetch database records without the server learning which records were requested, preserving full anonymity at Internet scale.

#### Why PIR matters  
Traditional PIR protocols were too heavy for on-chain use. Recent schemes‚Äîe.g. **Respire** and Frodo-PIR‚Äîsupport 2¬≤‚Å∞ elements (‚âà 1 million) with sub-second online latency and no trusted setup. By storing Merkle leaves/hashes in PIR-friendly chunks (32 B records) we can keep group trees on a server while users privately retrieve only the ~64 kB they need for a proof.

#### Technical Approach  

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Lean Incremental Merkle Tree (LeanIMT)** | Append-only tree used by Semaphore; gives deterministic indices so the client knows exactly which nodes to fetch. |
| **PIR Layer (Respire)** | Batched, lattice-based PIR with no offline phase; ideal for many small records. |
| **\`lean-imt\` integration** | Rust implementation and benchmarks with Respire |

**Data flow**  
1. Client computes the indices of its Merkle path.  
2. Client sends a PIR query for those indices to the server.  
3. Server responds with encrypted buckets; client decrypts to obtain hashes/leaves.  
4. Client generates the standard Semaphore ZK proof locally; nothing is leaked to the server.

#### Current Status (Apr 2025)  
- ‚úÖ ZK-Kit LeanIMT Rust implementation  
- üîÑ PIR proof-of-concept fetching 32-byte records from a 2¬≤‚Å∞-element DB

#### Use-cases Enabled  
- **World-scale anonymous voting** without delegating proofs to a company server.  
- **On-chain reputation** where users prove historical actions privately.  
- **Privacy-preserving NFT drops** that gate by membership but hide identities.
