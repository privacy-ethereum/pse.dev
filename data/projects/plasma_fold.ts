## Plasma Fold

**Reimagining Plasma with Folding Schemes**

Plasma Fold is an experimental Layer 2 (L2) design that combines the original Plasma architecture with modern zero-knowledge folding schemes to dramatically scale Ethereum transaction throughput. By leveraging recent advances in Incremental Verifiable Computation (IVC) and folding-based proof systems, Plasma Fold achieves high-speed client-side proving while keeping on-chain data to a minimum.

Unlike traditional rollups that post extensive transaction data to L1, Plasma Fold operates using a *minimal data availability* model inspired by Intmax, where only essential metadata—like tree roots and signer indices—are recorded onchain. Validity is ensured through user-generated proofs, making this model far more efficient for resource-constrained environments.

## Why Plasma Fold?

Most L2s today struggle to scale without relying on increasingly expensive data availability solutions (e.g., blobs). Plasma Fold offers a low-cost, high-throughput alternative. Inspired by Vitalik Buterin’s vision of a Plasma-EVM hybrid, Plasma Fold explores the use of folding schemes to support lightweight client-side proving—ideal for mobile or browser-based clients. In theory, this architecture could enable transaction rates in the range of 90k–260k TPS, matching or exceeding centralized systems like VISA.

## Key Innovations

- **Client-Side Proving with Folding Schemes:** Users generate recursive ZK proofs on their devices to attest to their own balances and transactions, minimizing trust and computation on the L1.
- **UTXO-Based Design with IVC:** Transactions are modeled as UTXO trees, allowing users to maintain and prove their own balances incrementally across time.
- **Minimal Onchain Footprint:** Only block roots, nullifier indices, and signer bitmaps are posted on L1—greatly reducing gas costs and data needs.
- **Instant Exits & Offline-Friendliness:** Users can exit the system at any time using a locally stored proof. They do not need to stay online between blocks unless actively transacting.
- **Composable and Future-Proof:** Designed to eventually support multiple assets, order books, and potentially even programmable features.
